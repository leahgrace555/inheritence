## Interfaces

### Challenge (Day 1):
1. 
- create a restaurant class in which each restaurant has a name, rating and price category
- implement a constructor and toString method. Test to make sure your constructor is behaving as expected

2.
- create a review class with a body, author, and number of stars
- write a review constructor, toString method and test that your constructor is working

3. Choose an implementation (inheritence or interface) and implement it

4. 
- Add an instance method addReview that takes in a review instance and associates it with a restaurant. The restaurant's rating should change based on this review
### Challenge ( Day 2):
